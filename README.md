## ðŸ“„ Overview

This thesis explores the physical, mathematical, and historical development of black holes within the framework of general relativity and quantum theory.

Key topics include:

- Derivations from special and general relativity  
- The Einstein field equations and Schwarzschild solution  
- Anti-de Sitter and Reissnerâ€“NordstrÃ¶m black holes  
- Light deflection and geodesics in curved spacetime  
- Black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation  
- The relation between entropy and horizon area via Wick rotation

Each section integrates historical context alongside rigorous mathematical derivation, with a focus on conceptual clarity and theoretical consistency.
